## Style Guidelines:

- A light color scheme to evoke a clean, serene, and inviting atmosphere.
- Primary color: Muted Rose (#B784A7). This shade suggests sophistication and a sense of calm, reminiscent of classic stationery or formal invitations, without being overly rigid.
- Background color: Very Light Rose (#F4F0F3). This heavily desaturated hue of the primary provides a soft, paper-like canvas that supports readability and depth.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender-Rose (#E084B4). This analogous hue offers a subtle, uplifting contrast to draw attention to interactive elements, suggesting surprise and gentle revelation.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif). Chosen for its humanist qualities, balancing modern readability with a warm, inviting personality, perfect for conveying a personal message.
- Clean, elegant line icons. Employ minimalist vector graphics that subtly enhance user interaction without distracting from the central visual metaphor of the envelope.
- A focused, centered layout. The envelope takes prominence at the center of the screen, surrounded by ample whitespace, creating a sense of anticipation and minimalist elegance.
- Smooth, sequential unfolding animations. Transitions from closed to open should be graceful and delightful, mirroring the physical act of opening an envelope, creating a moment of discovery.
